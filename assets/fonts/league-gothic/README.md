[League Gothic](https://github.com/theleagueof/league-gothic) is a revival of an old classic, and one of our favorite
typefaces, Alternate Gothic #1.
It was originally designed by [Morris Fuller Benton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton) for
the [American Type Founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders) Company in 1903.
The company went bankrupt in 1993, and since the original typeface was created over 95 years ago, the typeface is in the
public domain.

We decided to make our own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement.
Thanks to a commission from the fine & patient folks over at [WND.com](https://www.wnd.com/), itâ€™s been revised &
updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, and [Dannci](https://twitter.com/dannci), who contributed extra
glyphs.
